      <h2>Talk: Security in the FaaS Lane</h2>
      <p>Security in FaaS isnâ€™t what we are used to, but this talk shows you how what we learned in appsec still applies. Using LambHack, which is a vulnerable serverless application written in Go on AWS Lambda using Sparta, we will evaluate how to do security in serverless.</p>
