      <h2>Talk: Rainbows, Unicorns, and other Fairy Tales in the Land of Serverless Dreams</h2>
      <p>With all the Serverless hype it’s easy to get caught up in the dream but the reality is not always Rainbows and Unicorns. Sometimes leprechauns steal your gold and unicorns bite! In this talk I’ll take you on some of my own journeys with Azure Functions and how I ensured I always had a happy ending!</p>
