      <h1>Brian LeRoux</h1>
      <p>Brian LeRoux is currently building a continuous delivery vehicle for cloud functions called begin.com on an open source foundation called arc.codes. Previously he worked at Adobe on PhoneGap and Apache Cordova. He also created wtfjs.com and sports a questionable tattoo. Brian believes the future will be writ as functions, seamlessly running in the cloud, agnostic of vendors, on an open source platform and it will be stewarded by hackers like you.</p>
      <h2>Talk: Functions: Faster to Deploy</h2>
      <p>The secret weapon of serverless architectures is extremely fast deployments with zero downtime. Surgical deploys also allow for updating a single function in placeâ€¦within 1 second.<br/><br/>All this adds up to faster iterations, which means quicker turnaround and that equals: super stoked devs!</p>
