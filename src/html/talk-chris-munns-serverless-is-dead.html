      <h2>Talk: Serverless is Dead!</h2>
      <p>Long live Serverless! Since the launch of AWS Lambda in 2014 the industry has battled around what the word “serverless” has meant. I say, in 2019 who cares? In this talk we’ll cut past the hype and talk about the realities of what this technology space means, how it’s changing how companies build and operate technology, and how you can properly understand the value it brings to the table.</p>
